# <Tool Name> Playbook

This playbook documents how to use **<tool name>** in AI-assisted engineering workflows.

It focuses on:
- what this tool is good at
- when to use it
- when *not* to use it
- how it fits with other tools

This is operational guidance, not rules.

## What <Tool Name> Is Good At

Use <tool name> when you need:
- <primary strength>
- <secondary strength>
- <typical scenarios>

This tool is most effective when:
- <assumptions about scope>
- <assumptions about context>
- <assumptions about human involvement>

---

## What <Tool Name> Is NOT For

Do **not** rely on <tool name> to:
- <anti-pattern>
- <anti-pattern>
- <anti-pattern>

If you need those, use a different tool.

---

## Assumptions

This playbook assumes:
- canonical-guidelines are known and respected
- project-level context already exists
- outputs will be reviewed by a human

This tool does not replace ownership or judgment.

---

## Common Usage Patterns

### 1. <Pattern Name>

Use <tool name> to:
- <action>
- <action>

Typical use cases:
- <example>
- <example>

### 2. <Pattern Name>

Use <tool name> to:
- <action>
- <action>

Think of this as:
- <mental model>

---

## Guardrails

When using <tool name>:
- <constraint>
- <constraint>
- <constraint>

If these guardrails are violated, stop.

---

## Failure Modes & Risks

Common risks:
- <risk>
- <risk>

Mitigation:
- <mitigation>
- <mitigation>

---

## Relationship to Other Playbooks

- <tool A>: <how they differ>
- <tool B>: <how they differ>

This tool should be combined deliberately, not automatically.

---

## Relationship to Canonical Guidelines

<tool name>:
- does not define rules
- does not override invariants
- must operate within canonical-guidelines

If outputs conflict with canonical rules, the outputs are wrong.

---

## Summary

Use <tool name> when:
- <one-line decision rule>
